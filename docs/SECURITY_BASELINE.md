# Security Baseline Verification

## Preview Validation Checklist (task-00029)

- [x] Guard source verified at repository root: `middleware.ts`
- [x] Matcher scope verified: `config.matcher = ['/app/:path*']`
- [x] Unauthenticated `/app/*` requests redirect to `/login?next=<encoded(pathname+search)>`
- [x] Authenticated `/app/*` requests pass through via `NextResponse.next()` when `session` or `auth-token` cookie exists
- [ ] Strict internal-only redirect enforcement for `/login?next` (current `startsWith('/')` allows protocol-relative forms like `//example.com`)

Preview outcome for task-00029: **FAIL** (open-redirect hardening gap in `next` sanitization rule).

## task-00024 — Final auth/guard verification pass

Final verification source of truth remains **root `middleware.ts`** for `/app/:path*` protection, with login redirect sanitization enforced in both `src/ui/login.tsx` and `src/app/auth/login/route.ts`.

| Case | Expected | Evidence | Result | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unauthenticated access to `/app/*` | Redirect to `/login?next=<encoded-internal-path>` | `middleware.ts` computes `next = pathname + search`; when no `session`/`auth-token` cookie exists, it redirects to ``/login?next=${encodeURIComponent(next)}``. | **PASS** | Unauthenticated requests are consistently redirected to login with encoded internal return path. |
| Authenticated access to `/app/*` | Allow request to continue | `middleware.ts` sets `hasSession` true when either `session` or `auth-token` cookie is present, then returns `NextResponse.next()`. | **PASS** | Placeholder authenticated state permits access to protected app routes without redirect. |
| `/login?next=` safety behavior | Reject/sanitize non-internal redirects | `src/ui/login.tsx` only accepts `next` values starting with `/`; otherwise falls back to `/`. `src/app/auth/login/route.ts` also enforces `toSafeRedirect(next)` with same internal-only rule. | **PASS** | External/open redirect payloads are sanitized to `/` in both client flow and auth endpoint response contract. |

### Final pass outcome

- Overall outcome: **PASS**
- Blockers: **None**
- Guard location and scope confirmed: root `middleware.ts`, matcher `['/app/:path*']`

## task-00021 — Final guard verification rerun

Verification source of truth for middleware guard behavior is **root `middleware.ts`** (explicitly verified). `src/middleware.ts` does not exist in this repo, preventing false BLOCKED findings from wrong-path checks.

| Case | Expected | Evidence | Result | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unauthenticated access to `/app/*` | Redirect to `/login?next=<encoded-internal-path>` | Root `middleware.ts` checks missing `session`/`auth-token`, builds `next` from ``${pathname}${search}``, and redirects using `encodeURIComponent(next)`. | **PASS** | Guard path executes for unauthenticated requests and sends login redirect with encoded `next` preserving internal route context. |
| Authenticated access to `/app/*` | Allow request to continue | Root `middleware.ts` sets `hasSession` true when either `session` or `auth-token` cookie is present, then returns `NextResponse.next()`. | **PASS** | Valid placeholder auth cookie bypasses redirect path and allows app route handling. |
| Invalid `next` handling | Reject/sanitize non-internal redirects | `src/ui/login.tsx` reads query `next` and only accepts values where `raw.startsWith('/')`; otherwise it falls back to `DEFAULT_REDIRECT = '/'`. | **PASS** | Open/external redirect inputs are sanitized to `/`, preserving internal-only redirect contract. |

### Guard location + scope (explicit)

- Guard location verified: `middleware.ts` at repository root
- Non-source-path check: `src/middleware.ts` is absent (not used for verification)
- Matcher scope: `config.matcher = ['/app/:path*']`

## task-00018 — Middleware Guard Restore (rapid fix)

| Case | Expected | Evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unauthenticated access to `/app/*` | Redirect to `/login?next=<encoded-internal-path>` | `middleware.ts` checks for `session` or `auth-token` cookies and redirects with `NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login?next=' + encodeURIComponent(pathname + search), request.url))`. | **PASS** |
| Matcher scope | Guard applies only to protected app routes | `middleware.ts` exports `config.matcher = ['/app/:path*']`. | **PASS** |
| Authenticated access to `/app/*` | Allow request to continue | `middleware.ts` returns `NextResponse.next()` when placeholder session cookie check passes. | **PASS** |

### Current Guard Behavior

- Guard location: root `middleware.ts`
- Protected route scope: `/app/:path*`
- Session/auth check (placeholder): cookie presence of either `session` or `auth-token`
- Unauthenticated behavior: redirect to `/login?next=<pathname+search>` with URL-encoded `next`

## Historical Note (task-00017)

The earlier **BLOCKED** finding for missing `/app/*` guard wiring is resolved by the middleware restoration above.

## task-00042 — Shell/nav security visibility baseline

### Baseline assumptions

- Current shell is treated as a **single authenticated product role** (no in-app role split enforced yet).
- Navigation visibility is therefore currently aligned with authenticated access, not role-level authorization.
- Route protection for product surfaces continues to rely on middleware scope for `/app/:path*` plus server-side checks where sensitive actions are introduced.

### Future admin-role notes (`/configure`, `/admin`)

- `/configure` and `/admin` are treated as **future privileged surfaces** and should not be exposed by default to the single-role shell nav.
- When admin RBAC lands, both nav visibility and route/action authorization must enforce `admin` (or equivalent privileged claim), not just UI hiding.
- Direct URL access to admin surfaces must fail closed (redirect to safe location or return 403) for non-admin users.

### Access-control matrix (shell pages)

| Surface | Unauthenticated | Authenticated (current single-role) | Authenticated (future non-admin) | Authenticated (future admin) | Guard expectation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/login` | Allowed | Allowed (typically redirects into app flow) | Allowed | Allowed | Public entry point; sanitize `next` to internal paths only. |
| `/app/*` | Redirect to `/login?next=...` | Allowed | Allowed | Allowed | Enforced by middleware matcher `/app/:path*`; server checks required for sensitive operations. |
| `/configure` (planned) | Deny/redirect to login | Not yet exposed as privileged in current baseline | Deny/redirect or 403 | Allowed | Require explicit admin-role guard in middleware/server handlers; nav item visible only to admin. |
| `/admin` (planned) | Deny/redirect to login | Not yet exposed as privileged in current baseline | Deny/redirect or 403 | Allowed | Require explicit admin-role guard in middleware/server handlers; never rely on client-only visibility control. |

### Verification outcome (task-00042)

- Outcome: **PASS**
- Type: Documentation baseline alignment (no runtime behavior change introduced in this task)
